My ideal job that I can see myself doing is cyber security for a company like <br>AEMO, being the lead defence and seeking out different hackers or trojans or worms designed<br> to steal information from a company that could hurt the company or its clientele. <br>Being able to defend a company like in the tv show Mr. Robot makes me excited to study the field<br> and be able to have a career in cyber security.
<br>To be able to qualify to successfully work in a cyber security job I would need <br>a degree in an IT field such as a bachelor’s in cyber security in Computer Science. You would need<br> to be able to demonstrate key understandings of network defence, firewall safety protocols and<br> know how to code in multiple languages in order to create complex algorithms to protect a<br> server from a hack.
<br>At the moment the skills I have include being able to encrypt a hard drive, being<br> able to read code and find different ways to make programming easier in the long run <br>and finding the cause of most problems on computers thanks to the teachings from my dad. <br> I’m not yet qualified but I know how to do most things in the qualification and if I can’t or <br>don’t know how – ill find the answer through research and perseverance. 
<br>Currently I have a 10-step plan on how I’m going to obtain everything necessary<br> to obtain a job in defence or in game design. The first 4 steps involve me going to Uni to get <br>a degree to further my knowledge on everything computer related so I can feel confident in <br>my abilities to give answers in problem solving on computer servers and networks or on the<br> programming side of things. Steps 5-8 involve me getting real world experience so I can start to <br>develop and build a career for the rest of my life and then steps 8-10 involve me <br>starting my own firm that contracts for multiple companies. <br>SEEK.
