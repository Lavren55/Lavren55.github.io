<br>A Looking for Group app for Gaming networks that help people find <br>others they are comfortable with talking to so they can progress with in game missions <br>or simple team games such as Call of Duty. <br>
<br>The App will be call The Hub and it will be able to connect<br> people whether they need a group of people to get through assignments with or if they<br> are stuck in an in game raid and need one more person to complete it rather than <br>quitting and taking another hour to find someone and then taking another 4 hours to <br>complete the mission.
<br>The main motivation I have for creating an app like this is because<br> I know too well the struggles of trying to find a group and no one wanting to make the first<br> move, well the point of this app is to ask you certain questions to understand what <br>you are like and then pair you with people who play the same video game and want more<br> players in there team, it gives you the means to find that person you are looking for. <br>There are millions of gamers, yet some people are stuck doing things on their own<br> because they can’t find a group, they can feel they belong in. that’s the point of The Hub! <br> Using a tool such as MIT app inventor it could lay the groundwork to be able to run<br> the app for others to use.
<br>For the app to work, I would need access to different servers and permissions from massive gaming companies who want to back an app like this. <br>It would have a starting feature where you can describe yourself and create a profile and <br>sign up, you would then be connected to different groups via different key words in your <br>profile to help you find people you feel you could talk to easier and play with easier<br> without being nervous. After creating your account you’ll be taken through a questionnaire that helps you <br>to detail games you like to play and enjoy so in the suggested feed it comes up with the relevant games to play. It would take many of databases and be able to <br>connect in real time to a relevant server or client to help you find what you are looking for.

<br>The app would have 3 key features:
<br>1:This would give you the option to add as much information as you want to add or customise. You could add the various accounts a build of different<br> characters in games you play for example you could say “Hey guys I run a titan on destiny” <br> and through that it would take key words and in its search look for teams that are in need of a titan. <br> It would allow you to connect your profiles from various games on PlayStation, <br> Xbox or PC and show off your own profile to other people. <br>You would be able to customise every aspect of it from your own picture to the colour of your background.
<br>2: Having a looking for group button that you could press on a game that you enjoy that would automatically connect you to a group looking for someone with your requirements as a player. This would help you find people to do longer missions that require more people like a raid in games such as Destiny or World of Warcraft, or if you are looking for a team to play with competitively in games such as CS:Go or Call of Duty you could upload your account that you play well on and find a team that suits how you play and what you want to play with. 
<br>3: Having a step by step walkthrough guide on various missions from different games that you are stuck on. Now this guide would work in much of the sense other online guides do, you would go through the various guides on the app too look for information regarding missions that you are stuck on, it could link to various YouTube channels that have the guide on there or find you a step by step walkthrough online that can give you a hand on looking for rare artefacts or tedious missions that you just can’t seem to find/solve. 

<br>For something like this to work I would need access to lots of data servers with about <br>10 servers for each option to start off with, it would be created for a smartphone and <br>then later created to run on PC. For the app to run it would need access to real time <br>servers as well being able to find a group much like how you get connected to different <br>drivers in various ride share apps.
<br>In terms of software and hardware to create this app, I would need 3-5 people all <br>knowing how to code in java to create a basis for the app. I would need someone who <br>knows networking as well to set up the server side of the app where all the information <br>is held. I would then also need to get a lot of servers and a real time engine running <br>24/7 to keep the app sustained. To create something this enormous would take lots of <br>dedication and hard work but its outcome and ability would set the grounds for a new <br>wave of gaming connection.
<br>If this project hits the market and takes off by storm it would be nicknamed the <br>Facebook for gamers in my mind, with a whole new way of connecting players over different <br>console with new games allowing cross-platform play, this would help fuel games to <br>become even bigger than before. Its impact would mean that anyone that plays games <br>for fun can find someone to enjoy their newest game with or just simply share their <br>thoughts with another person about the newest game they just played. It would fix the <br>problem of many groups failing to play because they can’t find one person.
