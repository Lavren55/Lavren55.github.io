		 <P><i><H2>When I was 7 my dad started to introduce me to the world of computing<br> as he was a software engineer for Hewlett Packard before branching off to create his<br> own company called Broken Windows Computers. He introduced me to building computers<br> learning the basics to installing software and creating your own partition for a hard drive. <br> After graduating Highschool I went to do work experience with dad and I can remember<br> one project we had to do that required to install windows 64 bit on 26 computers with<br> different windows licences as well( I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many<br> motherboards and ram sticks in my life!). I find gaming to be the biggest part of my<br> interest in Computing as it still blows my mind when it takes me an hour to walk<br> from one side of a map to another and the level of detail that goes into making the<br> grass realistic.
I chose RMIT because when I was in year 12 it was the university I had<br> picked to be the one I always wanted to get my degree from, the technical labs it had and<br> even the feeling of it being chill and not stressing about everything gave me a feeling<br> of home sort of vibe. And due to that 5 years later it still had me thinking <br>I need to apply to RMIT because that’s the Uni I want to Graduate from.
<br>During my studies at RMIT I want to learn more in the field of<br> programming and cyber security as my dream jobs are either being able to see my name<br> at the credits of the next big game and it says “Lead software Engineer Joshua Laver” or <br>Creating my own cyber security firm and being able to stop everyday people from having<br> their details hacked from just their basic home computer to the subscription service<br> like Netflix that they pay for. Cyber security has always been a massive interest <br>of mine after the day I did my work experience at SEEK learning centre and being <br>shown all the different ways people try to break into websites, whether it was a simple<br> hack or a more complicated attack like a worm burrowing its way through the safety<br> protocols.
