		 <P><i><H2>Hey what’s up? My name is Joshua Laver, I was born on the 17th of January 1997. <br>When I was a kid, I fell in love with 4 things,<br> WWE, Football(soccer), Gaming and computers. <br>The first time I ever played a game was way back in 2001 when my dad brought home<br> the very first PlayStation 1 with Crash Bandicoot and Ratchet and Clank.<br> Since then I have become a huge gamer, having over 2000 hours with some games like<br> League of Legends, FIFA and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.From the age of 6 I fell in love with football and following a team called Arsenal Fc.<br> Football has been my passion for a long time alongside coding. <br> I played football for Caulfield Cobras for 11 years. <br>In my last two years of playing we were undefeated in both seasons <br> and I scored the most goals for our club in my 6th year of being a striker for the club before <br> moving to being a goalie as the one we had left and no one wanted to replace him. 
That’s when my passion for coding kicked in and I learnt to code <br> in Python, Ruby, HTML and a bit of c+. I studied I.T in Highschool with my final project being <br> a calculator that was advanced enough to do square roots. In Highschool I also learned to <br>speak in French and Italian and loved studying science subjects like Biology, Chemistry <br>and Physics!
