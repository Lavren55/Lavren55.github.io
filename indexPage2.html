<br>After taking the Myer Briggs 16 Personalities test, the Learning styles test and the<br> Big Five Personality test, I have found that all three agree with one thing in common – that I <br>am a very verbal and extraverted person while still staying grounded and remaining calm when put <br>under lots of pressure. To me these tests give me courage and confidence because they tell me <br>that all the areas that I usually have doubts in I actually excel at. For instance, in the 16 Personality<br> test I got Entrepreneur, and in the big 5 I got Ocean which both have extraverted and<br> sociable as the biggest parts of them. Being able to say I relate to the likes of Samuel L Jackson<br> and Nicolas Sarkozy the ex-president of France gives me hope that I can speak well in front<br> of others when I thought I had major stage fright issues. 
<br>When it comes to working in teams and groups, I have always found myself<br> to be confident and try to lead the group. I have always found myself in situations like at<br> my current job where even though I don’t have the title of manager or supervisor I’m still helping <br>to run the back of venue teams to make sure everything gets done. I feel I may butt heads with<br> people at times but that’s only because I want things to get done well and not at the bare minimum. <br> When forming a team, I would like to find people that are hugely <br>outgoing and are open to conversations none stop while still being able to get all our work done for the day. <br>The current group that I am in seem like awesome people to work with so I’m very excited to <br>create and design a project with them. <br>
